The Postman VS Code extension enables you to develop and test your APIs in Postman directly from Visual Studio Code. This streamlines your development workflow because you can quickly test your APIs in the same application you're using to develop. You can use the VS Code extension to organize your API requests in Postman Collections, and share them with your team using workspaces. You can also manage environments from the VS Code extension, enabling you to group related variables and share them with your team.

The VS Code extension enables you to:

* Create and send HTTP, raw WebSocket, and gRPC requests.
* Import collections and environments exported from Postman, and import requests from cURL commands.
* Write and view collection documentation.
* Edit and send requests from a workspace's request history.
* Create cookies and send them with requests.
* Create and manage collections and environments.
* Run a collection's requests in a sequence using the Collection Runner.
* Troubleshoot API requests in the Postman Console.

> The Postman VS Code extension is in beta.
